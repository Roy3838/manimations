# Videos

## These videos were used in projects concerning my Physics classes:

<img src="./rendered/480p/Potential-resized.gif" alt="Quantum" width="495" height="270">

This first video is a visualization of quantum tunneling, using the metaphor of various classical objects instead of a wave function. 


<img src="./rendered/480p/SIR_neural_Net-resized.gif" alt="Quantum" width="495" height="270">

This video explains the architecture of a NN model we used to recognize various r0 values given data produced from a SIR model.


## Animations made to explain Misc Math subjects:

<img src="./rendered/480p/Euler-resized.gif" alt="Euler" style="float: left; width: 270; height: 495; margin-right: 10px;"> <img src="./rendered/480p/cripto-resized.gif" alt="Cripto" style="float: right; width: 270; height: 495;">

The first video is a visualization of Euler numerical integration.
The second video explains how a blockchain works.
